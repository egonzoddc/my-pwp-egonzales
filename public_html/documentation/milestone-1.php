			<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> I am building this PWP (Personal Web Page) to help me obtain more work either by freelance or contract work with my business by showing my past experience and new knowledge that I am gaining in my
			deepdive coding class.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This PWP is to be viewed by potential employers, clients, friends, peers and anyone who wants to know and to understand all experience that I have
			gained and to highlight all my accomplishments, achievements, and certifications that I have done over the course of my work history.</p>

	<h1 align="center"><strong></strong><font size="5">Goals:</font></h1>
<div>
		<ul align="center">To acquire either full-time, part-time or contract work with either my low voltage or coding skills.</ul>
		<ul align="center">To showcase work that I have done and completed in both coding and low voltage.</ul>
		<ul align="center">To attract more business to my low voltage company</ul>
		<ul align="center">To show that I now will have the capability to build websites along with the work that I already do.</ul>
		<ul align="center">To ultimately end up on a website that I will build from scratch for my business Integrated Media Solutions so my targeted audience will know more about me.</ul>
		<ul align="center">To state my endgame of my career out look which will be working with DoD in a cybrer security division somewhere.</ul>

		<h2 align="center"><strong></strong><font size="5">Persona:</font></h2>
			<p align="center">I am Efren Gonzales I am a 39 year old low voltage technician and business owner. I have been in the low voltage field for almost 23 years.
			I sell, service and install everthing from simple phone systems to full on business network solutions. Small home security systems and CCTV systems to
			full on multi zone and channel commercial security systems. Fire alarm systems for businesses. Home entertainment and home automation systems. I integrate
			all that technology together and can put the controls of those systems into a simple easy to use app on your phone or computer. I am building this PWP to
			showcase my knowledge, skills, certifications and achievements in hopes of getting more work via contracts with other small business owners or individuals.
			I would like for potential clients to reference my PWP to see what I am capiable of to make them feel more comfortable in hiring me to do their work. I would
			like to continue to update this PWP with the new work in computer coding and other work that I do with my business in hopes of eventually landing a job
			somewhere within the Department of Defence doing cyber security work for them within the next 5-7 years. During that time it is my goal to have my current
			business be able to keep me busy enough with this new service I will be able to provide of building websites which in turn will get me the experience needed
			to continue to move forward in that field leaving my small business to run itself while I pursue my ultimate goal working with DoD writing code for them.</p>
