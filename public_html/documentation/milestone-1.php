			<p align="center">I am Jason and I am a hiring manager for a large developing company and I am looking for an employee that has experience in coding and technology. This personal website was
			part of an application that was sent to me. It gives me detail of the possible employee such as his age, current and present jobs, technology he has been associated with and
			other important aspects of his life and experience. I will be using the information that I was able to get off of this PWP to make a decision on his possible future employment with our development
			firm. It shows me quite a bit of information to help me make the decision on weather he would be a good fit into our firm and team. It also shows me that he is keeping up with new technology that is
			coming out and maintaining his knowledge in his current and future fields of study.</p>
